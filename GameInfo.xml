            You wake up to the sound of the church bell ringing.
            Your mother is baking bread on the stove, and rocking in a chair.
            You get out of bed, and go to her.
            "They're coming for you," she says. She hands you a bag, and says
            "Better pack your things and sneak out while you can."

                            You ask your mom to come with you, but she says she has to stay here.
                            She gives you a loaf of bread, and you add it to your bag.
