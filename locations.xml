            You wake up to the sound of the church bell ringing.
            Your mother is baking bread on the stove, and rocking in a chair.
            You get out of bed, and go to her.
            "They're coming for you," she says. She hands you a bag, and says
            "Better pack your things and sneak out while you can."
        </prompt>
